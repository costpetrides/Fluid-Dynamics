Welcome to my 2D shallow Water simulation !


Here you can find a simulation that solves the 2D shallow water equations using finite
differences where the momentum equations are taken to be linear, but the
continuity equation is solved in its nonlinear form! 

    \begin{equation}
    \frac{3}{3}
    \end{equation}

    du/dt - fv = -g*d(eta)/dx + tau_x/(rho_0*H)- kappa*u
    dv/dt + fu = -g*d(eta)/dy + tau_y/(rho_0*H)- kappa*v
    d(eta)/dt + d((eta + H)*u)/dx + d((eta + H)*u)/dy = sigma - w

where f = f_0 + beta*y can be the full latitude varying coriolis parameter.
For the momentum equations, an ordinary forward-in-time centered-in-space
scheme is used. However, the coriolis terms is not so trivial, and thus, one
first finds a predictor for u, v and then a corrected value is computed in
order to include the coriolis terms. In the continuity equation, it's used a
forward difference for the time derivative and an upwind scheme for the non-
linear terms. The model is stable under the CFL condition of

    dt <= min(dx, dy)/sqrt(g*H)    and    alpha << 1 (if coriolis is used)

where dx, dy is the grid spacing in the x- and y-direction respectively, g is
the acceleration of gravity and H is the resting depth of the fluid."""
